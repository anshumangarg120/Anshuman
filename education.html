                degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) through lateral entry at SSSUTMS Sehore University. 
                This three-year program provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various subjects, including power systems,
                 electrical machines, control systems, digital electronics, and microprocessors. I also gained knowledge in electrical circuit analysis,
                  power distribution, renewable energy systems, and electrical equipment.
                Recently, I appeared for the last semester exam of my BE program in May 2023. 
                I also honed my skills in using software tools relevant to electrical engineering."</h2>
